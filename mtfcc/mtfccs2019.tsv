This category includes Interstate highways, as well as all other highways with limited access (some of which are toll roads). Limited-access highways with only one lane in each direction, as well as those that are undivided, are also included under S1100.
S1200	Road/Path Features	Secondary Road	N	Y	N	Secondary roads are main arteries that are not limited access, usually in the U.S. highway, state highway, or county highway systems. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each direction, may or may not be divided, and usually have at-grade intersections with many other roads and driveways. They often have both a local name and a route number.
S1400	Road/Path Features	Local Neighborhood Road, Rural Road, City Street	N	Y	N	Generally a paved non-arterial street, road, or byway that usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. Roads in this feature class may be privately or publicly maintained. Scenic park roads would be included in this feature class, as would (depending on the region of the country) some unpaved roads.
S1500	Road/Path Features	Vehicular Trail (4WD)	N	Y	N	An unpaved dirt trail where a four-wheel drive vehicle is required. These vehicular trails are found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in the S1400 category.
S1630	Road/Path Features	Ramp	N	Y	N	A road that allows controlled access from adjacent roads onto a limited access highway, often in the form of a cloverleaf interchange.
S1640	Road/Path Features	Service Drive usually along a limited access highway	N	Y	N	A road, usually paralleling a limited access highway, that provides access to structures and/or service facilities along the highway. These roads can be named and may intersect with other roads.
S1710	Road/Path Features	Walkway/Pedestrian Trail	N	Y	N	A path that is used for walking, being either too narrow for or legally restricted from vehicular traffic.
S1720	Road/Path	Stairway	N	Y	N	A pedestrian passageway from one level to another by a series of steps.
S1730	Road/Path Features	Alley	N	Y	N	A service road that does not generally have associated addressed structures and is usually unnamed. It is located at the rear of buildings and properties and is used for deliveries.
S1740	Road/Path Features	Private Road for service vehicles (logging, oil fields, ranches, etc.)	N	Y	N	A road within private property that is privately maintained for service, extractive, or other purposes. These roads are often unnamed.

S1780	Road/Path Features	Parking Lot Road	N	Y	N	The main travel route for vehicles through a paved parking area. This may include unnamed roads through apartment/condominium/office complexes where pull-in parking spaces line the road.
S1820	Road/Path Features	Bike Path or Trail	N	Y	N	A path that is used for manual or small, motorized bicycles, being either too narrow for or legally restricted from vehicular traffic.
